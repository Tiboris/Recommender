# Plex-Recommend
A standalone AI based application to learn what you like to watch on your Plex server and provide useful recommendations on what you may like.


Coming soon. Quasi functional model but fighting with NLP for understanding "themes and plots of shows" and not just relying on genre tags. The intent is for this to actually understand what shows mean.

Example. While lots of things are in action / drama, I want it to understand that Yellowstone is like 1883 which is like Landman (Temporal and semetic connections)

The final hope is a GUI based app that allows you to just run it, no need to do a bunch of fancy crap on your side, just fill in the basic config and run it.
